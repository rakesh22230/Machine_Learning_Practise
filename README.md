# XOR Problem with MLP (Machine Learning Practice)

This project implements a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** from scratch in Python (without deep learning frameworks) to solve the **XOR problem**.  
It includes:
- Forward and backward propagation
- Training with different hyperparameters
- Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC curve)
- Visualization of training loss

## üìÇ File Information
- **222902030_LabReport_03.ipynb** ‚Üí Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation and results.

## üöÄ Features
- Implementation of **Sigmoid** and **ReLU** activation functions
- Manual backpropagation
- Hyperparameter tuning for learning rate, epochs, and activation
- Evaluation with multiple metrics
- ROC curve plotting using `matplotlib`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
